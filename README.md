## MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/ <br/>
MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era. <br/>
### Documentation: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/introduction/ <br/>
## Mocha: https://mochajs.org/#installation <br/>
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. <br/>
## Mongoose: https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html <br/>
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. <br/>

## Nodemon: https://nodemon.io/ <br/> 

Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. Perfect for development. Install it using npm. <br/>

Just use nodemon instead of node to run your code, and now your process will automatically restart when your code changes. To install, get node.js, then from your terminal run: <br/>

npm install -g nodemon <br/>

Works with server applications or one time run utilities and REPLs. <br/>
Requirable in node apps. <br/>
